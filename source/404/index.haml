          ### Magic trick

          I'm a big fan of David Blaine, and this is a trick that he sometimes performs on stage. Here's what I want you to do:

          1. Think of something you like to eat for dessert, not something you'd eat at home like ice cream, but something you'd order at a restaurant like tiramisu
          2. Take the last letter of your dessert. With that letter, can you think of a US President who's last name begins with that letter?
          3. Take the 2nd letter of the President's last name, now think of a colour that begins with that letter.

          So you should now be thinking of a colour. Do you have one? Now, I don't think it would be an obvious colour like orange, I think you'd pick a colour that's harder to guess. When you're ready, [CLICK HERE](/404/reveal) to reveal my prediction!
