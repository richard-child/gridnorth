      # GNARBOX (Part 2): Editing photos and videos

      If you haven't already, please read <a href="/projects/gnarbox-part-1">GNARBOX (Part 1)</a> first. Designing how customers edit their photos and videos is one of the most important parts of the app. It’s also the most complicated, and we spent a lot of time refining the design. In this case study we’ll explore the editor in more detail, including designs for both mobile and tablet.

      ## Colour editor

      Customers horizontally scroll through options to make changes. We used a horizontal scroll so there’s more room for content to be displayed clearly. Customers can tap on the photo to preview any changes.

      ## Applying filters and cropping photos

      The app also comes with preset filters, for customers who want to quickly make edits without having to spend time manually adjusting colour settings.

      You can crop, rotate and set the aspect ratio all from one screen. Incremental rotations are also available using the default iOS rotator.

      ## Trimming videos and exporting frames

      The slow-mo and video trim elements follow the default iOS style, so they’ll be familiar to customers. To save space, we added overlay elements to the video, where you can set the slow-mo speed.

      Customers can export individual video frames as photos right within the app. Perfect for capturing stills if you’re only shooting video.

      ## Tablet editor

      The editor is also available for tablet, and each section was redesigned to take full advantage of the larger screen.

      ## Conclusion

      Tim and Will, the founders of GNARBOX, have a great understanding of their industry. And GNARBOX was designed to address some of the issues they both faced, as customers of competitor products. So when working on the app, they both were able to provide clear and concise feedback as users. Which was invaluable.
