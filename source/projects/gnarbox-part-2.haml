          ## GNARBOX (Part 2)

          If you haven't already, please read <a href="/case-studies/gnarbox-1">GNARBOX (Part 1)</a> first. Designing how customers edit their photos and videos <em>is one of the most important parts of the app</em>. It’s also the most complicated, and we spent a lot of time refining the design. In this case study we’ll explore the editor in more detail, including designs for both mobile and tablet.

          #### Colour editor

          Customers horizontally scroll through options to make changes. We used a horizontal scroll so there’s more room for content to be displayed clearly. Customers can tap on the photo to preview any changes.

          The app also comes with preset filters, for customers who want to quickly make edits <em>without having to spend time manually adjusting colour settings</em>.

          You can crop, rotate and set the aspect ratio all from one screen. Incremental rotations are also available using the default iOS rotator.

          Trimming videos
        :markdown
          The slow-mo and video trim elements follow the default iOS style, so they’ll be <em>familiar to customers</em>. To save space, we added overlay elements to the video, where you can set the slow-mo speed.

          Customers can export individual video frames as photos right within the app. Perfect for capturing stills if you’re only shooting video.
