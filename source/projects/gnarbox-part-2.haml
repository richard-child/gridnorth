      # GNARBOX (Part 2)

      If you haven't already, please read <a href="/projects/gnarbox-part-1">GNARBOX (Part 1)</a> first. Designing how customers edit their photos and videos <em>is one of the most important parts of the app</em>. It’s also the most complicated, and we spent a lot of time refining the design. In this case study we’ll explore the editor in more detail, including designs for both mobile and tablet.

      ## Colour editor

      Customers horizontally scroll through options to make changes. We used a horizontal scroll so there’s more room for content to be displayed clearly. Customers can tap on the photo to preview any changes.

      ## Applying filters

      The app also comes with preset filters, for customers who want to quickly make edits <em>without having to spend time manually adjusting colour settings</em>.

      You can crop, rotate and set the aspect ratio all from one screen. Incremental rotations are also available using the default iOS rotator.

      ## Trimming videos

      The slow-mo and video trim elements follow the default iOS style, so they’ll be <em>familiar to customers</em>. To save space, we added overlay elements to the video, where you can set the slow-mo speed.

      ## Exporting frames

      Customers can export individual video frames as photos right within the app. Perfect for capturing stills if you’re only shooting video.
