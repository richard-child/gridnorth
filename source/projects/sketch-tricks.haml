      # Sketch Tricks

      Back in 2013, when Sketch (software for designers) was new, <em>I started Sketch Tricks</em>. Where I wrote articles and shared resources to help designers improve their Sketch workflow. As a result, <em>I was asked to write a Sketch tutorial for Net magazine</em>.

      In 2015 I sold the domain name to a friend for a small amount, so they could continue working on the project. Before selling Sketch Tricks it had reached <em>3700+ email subscribers, 5500+ Twitter followers and 2300+ Medium followers</em>.
