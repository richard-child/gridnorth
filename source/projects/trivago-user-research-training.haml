      ## Testing a feature for the map

      The User Research team at trivago launched a pilot training for those interested in conducting their own user tests. The training included <em>writing a test plan, setting up a test on UserTesting.com, analysing the data and reporting the findings</em>.

      At the time I was also working on a feature for the trivago map, allowing users to see what places are nearby their hotel. Restaurants, shops, entertainment etc. So they can better plan their hotel stay.

      The name of this feature is called “What's nearby”. <em>So I used this training as an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of the copy</em>, as an entry point for adding places to the map.

      ## Test plan

      This would be measured by the answer participants gave to task 4: <em>“Without tapping anything yet, what do you think the button “What’s nearby” does? Why?”</em>

      The participant needs to correctly identify that the “What’s nearby” button is for adding places to the map, <em><strong>before</strong> tapping on the button</em>.

      ## Findings

      Whilst users understood that “What's nearby” was for adding places to the map. <em>Some participants thought they would only be shown near the <strong>selected</strong> hotel</em>.

      So we decided to change the copy to “Explore this area”. To make it clearer that <em>you’re searching for places within the visible map area</em>. Not just near the selected hotel.

      ## Conclusion

      What I found most challenging is writing the task questions. Being able to <em>clearly guide the user through the prototype, whilst not biasing them or prompting them in any way</em>.

      For example, if you wanted to find out if users understand how to use the search function within your product. <em>The question itself shouldn’t mention the word “search”</em>. As that’s already prompting the user.

      You also need to take into account that you might need to guide users <em>just incase they don’t find the search function</em>. So, for example, <em>your next question</em> could begin with “If you haven’t done so already, please tap on the search button…” So you give the user time to find the search button without prompting them, but then guide the user in the next question <em>so they’re able to continue with the rest of the test</em>.
