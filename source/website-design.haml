          Benefits of a Style Guide
        %p
          Let’s imagine that your new website is launched, but you want to add additional pages. You contact your favourite designer, but he’s unavailable (sorry!). You hire another designer, but the pages they design are inconsistent with the current website. Not only does this make life difficult for your developer, but it harms your brand.
        %p
          A Style Guide is a manual for your website. It provides instructions on how to create new pages and edit existing ones. It ensures consistency, one of the most important characteristics of any great brand, and to top if off, designers will love working with you!
        %p
          Sounds too good to be true, right? Style Guides are optional, and add extra cost, but they’re worth every dollar. I’m happy to explain Style Guides in more detail if we work together.
