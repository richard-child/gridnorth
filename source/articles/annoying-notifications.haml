          ## 71% of app uninstalls are because of annoying notifications

          This stat was shown on a slide at Facebookâ€™s F8 developer conference (source: <a href="https://www.prlog.org/12254771-top-7-reasons-why-mobile-users-uninstall-apps.html" target="_blank">Appiterate</a>). As a business owner, you might think that sending lots of notifications is a good thing, as they draw attention back to your app. But, more often than not theyâ€™re annoying, and will cause customers to uninstall your app. That said, if done the right way, <em>notifications can actually be useful</em>.

          #### Why are notifications annoying?

          When you send a notification it interrupts what that person was doing. So if you're sending an excessive amount of messages then the interruption isnâ€™t worth it. As an example, if you get 42 likes on a Facebook post and receive a notification for each, it doesnâ€™t make any sense. Thereâ€™s no action for you to take, and the <em>content doesnâ€™t justify that much interruption</em>.

          Additionally, if the message isnâ€™t relevant to the customer, then itâ€™s also annoying. You could be receiving notifications about sports that youâ€™re not interested in, or TV shows that you donâ€™t watch. The information is pointless.

          <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Crunchyroll">@Crunchyroll</a> hey, why do i keep getting push notifications for shows that i donâ€™t watch? thatâ€™s!! pretty annoying!! <a href="http://t.co/AqaqedHzKh">pic.twitter.com/AqaqedHzKh</a></p>&mdash; Nick Robinson (@Babylonian) <a href="https://twitter.com/Babylonian/status/405143075426533376">November 26, 2013</a></blockquote><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

          #### How many notifications should you send?

          We now know that itâ€™s important not to send an excessive amount of messages, but how many should you send? When sending 2-5 notifications in one week, 46% of customers said theyâ€™d opt-out. When sending 6-10 notifications in one week, 32% of customers will <strong>stop using the app altogether</strong> (source: <a href="http://info.localytics.com/blog/the-inside-view-how-consumers-really-feel-about-push-notifications" target="_blank">Localytics</a>).

          Every business is different, so itâ€™s important that you track how your customers are responding to the frequency and content of your messages.

          #### What makes a notification useful?

          Great notifications are <em>valuable, personalised and timely</em>. Netflix is a great example of a company that sends personalised messages. They simply let you know when a new season of your favourite TV show is available. Your customers will love to receive <em>infrequent updates about their personal interests</em>.

          You should also <em>consider the location of your customers</em>. How can you provide value at that exact moment in time? United Airlines sends you a notification if your gate changes. Waze will send you a notification if thereâ€™s traffic during your commute. This information is very valuable during that moment.

          <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Never seen gate-change push notifications before from <a href="https://twitter.com/united">@United</a>, but they&#39;re great: <a href="http://t.co/X41BJfz398">pic.twitter.com/X41BJfz398</a></p>&mdash; Tommy Collison (@tommycollison) <a href="https://twitter.com/tommycollison/status/444975612256854016">March 15, 2014</a></blockquote><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
