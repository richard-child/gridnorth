          ## 71% of app uninstalls are because of annoying notifications

          This stat was shown on a slide at Facebookâ€™s F8 developer conference (source: Appiterate Survey). As a business owner, you might think that sending lots of notifications is a good thing, as they draw attention back to your app. But, more often than not theyâ€™re annoying, and will cause customers to uninstall the app. That said, if done the right way, notifications can actually be useful.

          #### Why are notifications annoying?

          When you send a notification it interrupts what that person was doing. So if the message isnâ€™t relevant, or youâ€™re sending an excessive amount, then the interruption isnâ€™t worth it. As an example, if you get 42 likes on a Facebook post, and receive a notification for each, it doesnâ€™t make any sense. Thereâ€™s no action for you to take, and the content doesnâ€™t justify that much interruption.

          Additionally, if the message isnâ€™t relevant to the customer, then itâ€™s also annoying. You could be receiving notifications about sports that youâ€™re not interested in, or TV shows that you donâ€™t watch. The information is pointless.

          <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Crunchyroll">@Crunchyroll</a> hey, why do i keep getting push notifications for shows that i donâ€™t watch? thatâ€™s!! pretty annoying!! <a href="http://t.co/AqaqedHzKh">pic.twitter.com/AqaqedHzKh</a></p>&mdash; Nick Robinson (@Babylonian) <a href="https://twitter.com/Babylonian/status/405143075426533376">November 26, 2013</a></blockquote><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

          #### How many notifications should you send?

          We now know that itâ€™s important not to send an excessive amount of messages, but how many should you send? When sending 2-5 notifications in one week, 46% of customers said theyâ€™d opt-out. When sending 6-10 notifications in one week, 32% of customers will <strong>stop using the app altogether</strong> (source: <a href="http://info.localytics.com/blog/the-inside-view-how-consumers-really-feel-about-push-notifications" target="_blank">Localytics</a>).

          Every business is different, so itâ€™s important that you track how your customers are responding to the frequency and content of your messages.

          #### What makes a notification useful?

          Great notifications are valuable, personalised and timely. Netflix is a great example of a company that sends personalised messages. They simply let you know when a new season of your favourite TV show is available. Your customers will love to receive infrequent updates about their personal interests.

          You should also be timely and consider the location of your customers. How can you provide value at that exact moment in time? United Airlines sends you a notification if your gate changes. Waze will send you a notification if thereâ€™s traffic during your commute. This information is very valuable during that moment.
