                71% of app uninstalls are because of annoying notifications (Facebook F8 developer conference)

              This stat was shown on a slide at Facebook’s F8 developer conference. As a business owner, you might think that sending lots of notifications is a good thing, as they draw attention back to your app. But, more often than not they’re annoying, and will cause customers to uninstall your app. That said, if done the right way, <em>notifications can actually be useful</em>.

              Like many, I use Trello to keep track of all my projects. Recently, upon returning I noticed that the login form was prominently titled “Welcome back to Trello!”.

                How to build a pattern library in Sketch (Net magazine)
            %p
              Have you ever struggled with consistency in web design? This happens all too often, especially when working at scale. Luckily for us, pattern libraries are here to help! A pattern library is a collection of user interface design elements that can be reused to build pages.
