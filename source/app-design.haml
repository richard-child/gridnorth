          Struggling to keep your application consistent? A Style Guide is the solution!
        %p
          Let’s imagine that your new app is launched, but you want to make changes. You contact your favourite designer, but he’s unavailable (sorry!). You hire another designer, but what they design is inconsistent with the current app. Not only does this make life difficult for your developer, but it harms your brand.
        %p
          A Style Guide is a manual for your app. It provides instructions on how to create new sections and edit existing ones. It ensures consistency, one of the most important characteristics of any great brand, and to top if off, designers will love working with you!
        %p
          Sounds too good to be true, right? Style Guides are optional, and add extra cost, but they’re worth every dollar. I’m happy to explain Style Guides in more detail when we work together.

        Richard brought experience, creativity and common sense practicality to the design of our application. Our developers are incredibly pleased with the design and thoroughness of the corresponding documentation, both vital elements of the development cycle. Simply put, Richard helped our team take a sprawling prototype design and feature list into an intuitive product.
