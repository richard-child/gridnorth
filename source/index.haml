          I’m Richard Child, a web &amp; mobile designer with 5+ years experience!

          The problem
        %p
          As a business owner, you know your numbers and have a strong understanding of how your business works. But, what about your website/app? Websites and apps play such an important role in business today, can you really afford not to understand how yours was designed?
        %p
          You’ve worked with designers in the past, but design debates were based on aesthetics. Design isn’t art. Debating is healthy, as long as it’s focused on what’s important.

          My solution
        %p
          Our first meeting will be to discuss the business goals of the project. What’s wrong with your current website/app? Why do you want to spend money on a redesign? Why are you hiring me?
        %p
          During the process, I’ll deliver documents that outline my design thinking. Every decision I make will relate back to the answers you gave in our first meeting. Making sure that you understand the “why” behind my work.

          Why choose me?
        %p
          By designing based on pricinples, websites and apps I design become far easier to use. These principles are important to me, and lay the foundation for every project that I work on.
        %p
          As I continue to learn, these principles will be updated. In the future, I plan on writing about them in more detail. Below you can read a few examples.

          Examples of design principles
        %p.t-text--light
          Websites and apps reflect the values of their designers. Here are a few of mine.

          1. Accessibility
        %p
          I make sure that there’s enough contrast between colours, and that they pass Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

      .col-md-5.col-md-offset-1
        %h4
          2. Readability
        %p
          Font choice, font size, line length and line height. I focus on getting these details right to ensure text is easy to read.

      .col-md-5
        %h4
          3. Make it obvious
        %p
          As an example, sometimes an icon alone isn’t obvious. By simply adding text next to the icon, everyone now knows what it does.
