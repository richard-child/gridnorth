      # Hello, I'm Richard Child, Product Designer

      I've been a designer for <em>6+ years</em>, and during that time I've worked both full-time and as a freelancer for companies including <em>trivago, Cabify and GNARBOX</em>. I also have experience with user research, front-end development and writing. As I believe that learning about other disciplines makes me a better designer.

      I also enjoy working on personal projects. Currently, I'm writing and sharing poetry and short stories over at <a href="http://richardwrit.es" target="_blank">Richard Writes</a>. Back in 2013 when Sketch (software for designers) was new, <em>I started Sketch Tricks</em>. Where I wrote articles and shared resources to help designers improve their Sketch workflow. As a result, <em>I was asked to write a Sketch tutorial for Net magazine</em>.
