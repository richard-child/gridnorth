          ## Grid North Logo

          I donâ€™t offer branding services to clients, but I love designing my own logos for personal projects. I was struggling to come up with ideas for Grid North, so for inspiration, I started listening to renowned graphic designer Michael Beirut talk about his work. One of his projects was to create a new identity for Saks Fifth Avenue, and the shopping bags were designed by chopping up the logo into 64 squares using an 8x8 grid.

          #### Designing the logo

          Following the same principle, I overlaid a 2x2 grid onto a symbol that represented north. This creates 4 variations of the Grid North logo that are all different, yet clearly connected.

          #### On the web

          Taking it one step further, how can I show these variations throughout the website? A talented developer friend of mine, Michael Koper, helped me implement a system where a random logo is shown when a page is loaded. To see this in action, <em>simply refresh this page and watch the logo in the top left</em>.
