          ## Accent

          Accent is an iOS app that allows anyone to post a phrase and get it translated by locals. You can post an image, text, or even audio! As locals have knowledge that just isn’t available from machine-based translators, Accent’s competitive advantage is accuracy. Throughout the app, we wanted to emphasise the fact that every translation is human-powered.

          When Accent contacted me it, the app was still just an idea. I was hired to primarily work on the home feed and the process of posting a new phrase to be translated.

        :markdown
          The home feed is the main screen of the app. Users can see all of the phrases that have been posted for their chosen languages. They simply tap on a phrase to view more information and leave a translation. To minimise wait times, cards without any translations are prioritised.

          Using cards
        :markdown
          Each phrase is contained within a card. The design of cards allows for very clear visual separation. So there no confusion as users scroll through their feed.

          Structuring the information
        :markdown
          The translate to/from languages are the most important piece of information in each card, and are given the highest priority. Profile photos are shown to reinforce that Accent is about human-powered translations, and is not machine-based.

          #### Posting new phrases

          Imagine that you’re in a restaurant and you see a sign that you want translated, or you’re at an Airport and you want the ticket agent to speak into the microphone. Because of this, phrases can be posted to Accent via text, image and audio.
