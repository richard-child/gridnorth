          #### About Sketch Tricks

          Sketch is a piece of design software that designers use to create websites, apps, icons etc. When Sketch was new, I setup a website called Sketch Tricks, providing articles and resources for designers.

          A Medium publication was created, so that designers could contribute articles to the project. Once an article had been submitted, it was added to the website and shared amongst the community.

          Before selling Sketch Tricks, it had reached 5500+ Twitter followers, 2300+ Medium followers and 3700+ email subscribers. Sketch Tricks was sold to Marko VuletiÄ‡.

          Recently, I was asked to write a Sketch tutorial for Net magazine, on the subject of website guidelines. If you use Sketch, you can <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/build-pattern-library-sketch-101517315" target="_blank">read the article online</a>. Let me know what you think!
