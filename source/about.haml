          ### About Richard Child

          I actually studied 3D Design at University, but one day we were asked to build an online portfolio using tools such as Moonfruit and Wix. I remember being annoyed that I couldn’t customise the design, so I started learning web development on Treehouse.

          After switching career paths, my first job was at Cabify, a Spanish startup based in Madrid. Cabify designs and develops apps for personal transportation, and I worked on redesigning their iPhone and Android apps for <em>more than 100,000 customers in 4 countries</em>. Cabify was recognised as one of Europe’s fastest growing startups by The Next Web.

          One of my greatest achievements is cycling from Falmouth to Milan, raising money for charity. The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/HZ5zE" target="_blank">route was over 1000 miles</a>, taking our team 2 weeks to complete. I finished my first half marathon well under 2 hours, with a time of 1:59:59.

          ### Past projects

          * <em>Sketch Tricks (Resources for Designers)</em>: Before selling Sketch Tricks it had reached 5500+ Twitter followers, 2300+ Medium followers and 3700+ email subscribers. As a result, I was asked to write a Sketch tutorial for Net magazine.
          * <em>Sketch to HTML (Web Development)</em>: Similar to PSD to HTML services, Sketch to HTML has proven popular, with a large amount of enquiries coming through the website. Because of Sketch’s popularity we ended up selling the name to Xfive.
          * <em>Hymid R&D</em>: 3D designer, working closely with patients and hospital staff to develop <a href="/case-studies/kinex">Kinex</a>, an independent living product that dramatically improves the usability of crutches. Along with an investor, I started Hymid R&D to bring Kinex to market.
