          ### About Richard Child

          I actually studied 3D Design at University, but one day we were asked to build an online portfolio using tools such as Moonfruit and Wix. I remember being annoyed that I couldn’t customise the design, so I started learning web development on Treehouse.

          After switching career paths, my first job was at Cabify, a Spanish startup based in Madrid. Cabify designs and develops apps for personal transportation, and I worked on redesigning their iPhone and Android apps for <em>more than 100,000 customers in 4 countries</em>. Cabify was recognised as one of Europe’s fastest growing startups by The Next Web.

          One of my greatest achievements is cycling from Falmouth to Milan, raising money for charity. The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/HZ5zE" target="_blank">route was over 1000 miles</a>, taking our team 2 weeks to complete. I finished my first half marathon well under 2 hours, with a time of 1:59:59.
